        The USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map is the standard by which gardeners and growers can
        determine which perennial plants are most likely to thrive at a location. The map is based
        on the average annual extreme minimum winter temperature, displayed as 10-degree F zones and
        5-degree F half zones.
      </p>
      <h3>How are the zone numbers and colors interpreted? What do they mean?</h3>
      <p>
        The Plant Hardiness Zone Map (PHZM) is based on the average annual extreme minimum winter
        temperature, displayed as 10-degree F zones ranging from zone 1 (coldest) to zone 13
        (warmest). Each zone is divided into half zones designated as ‘a’ and ‘b’. For example, 7a
        and 7b are 5-degree F increments representing the colder and warmer halves of zone 7,
        respectively. These designations serve as convenient labels and shorthand for communicating
        and comparing the extreme winter temperatures within the United States and Puerto Rico. Zone
        numbers are typically listed with the descriptions of perennial plants in catalogs and other
        sales information produced by commercial nurseries, plant suppliers, etc.
      </p>
      <h3>How should I use the map when growing plants?</h3>
      <p>
        Consequently, growing plants at the extreme range of the coldest zone where they are adapted
        means that they could experience a year with a rare, extreme cold snap that lasts just a day
        or two, and plants that have thrived happily for several years could be lost. Gardeners need
        to keep that in mind and understand that past weather records cannot provide a guaranteed
        forecast for future variations in weather. They should consult with other knowledgeable
        producers and gardeners (e.g., established nurseries or Master Gardeners) or extension
        services (see the links on the homepage) with extensive expertise with conditions at their
        locales.

      <p>
        Furthermore, gardeners should recognize that many other environmental factors, in addition
        to hardiness zones, contribute to the success or failure of plants. Wind, soil type, soil
        moisture, humidity, pollution, snow, and winter sunshine can greatly affect the survival of
        plants. Warm season heat and moisture balance are particularly important in this regard. The
        way plants are placed in the landscape, how they are planted, and their size and health can
        also influence their survival.

        <p>
          • <strong>Light:</strong> To thrive, plants need to be planted where they will receive the
          proper amount of light. For example, plants that require partial shade that are at the
          limits of hardiness in your area might be injured by too much sun during the winter
          because it might cause rapid changes in the plant’s internal temperature.
        </p>
        <p>
          • <strong>Soil Moisture:</strong> Plants have different requirements for soil moisture,
          and this might vary seasonally. Plants that might otherwise be hardy in your zone might be
          injured if soil moisture is too dry in late autumn, and they enter dormancy while
          suffering moisture stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          • <strong>Temperature:</strong> Plants grow best within a range of optimal temperatures,
          both cold and hot. That range may be wide for some varieties and species but narrow for
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          • <strong>Duration of Exposure to Cold:</strong>Duration of exposure to cold: Many plants
          that can survive a short period of exposure to cold may not tolerate longer periods of
          cold weather.
        </p>
        <p>
          • <strong>Humidity:</strong> High relative humidity limits cold damage by reducing
          moisture loss from leaves, branches, and buds. Cold injury can be more severe if the
          humidity is low, especially for evergreens.
